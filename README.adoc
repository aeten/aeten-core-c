Ã†ten C core library
===================

Object oriented C library.

Headers and the corresponding C skeletons implemention can be generated from UML class diagramm.
The generation supports XMI (tested from PlantUML xmi:star output).

Depedencies for runtime are:

 * glibc
 * libpthread

Depedencies for compilation are:

 * gcc
 * ninja (ninja-build)
 * bash
 * gawk
 * xmlstarlet

The build system is under construction and needs some improvements:

    ( cd cots/plantuml; ant )
    ./configure
    ninja deps
    ninja -j 1
    sudo ninja install

You cane use `./configure --help` for more options.
